<h4>Overview<h4>
The BEGINING Scale is an innovative psychological and analytical tool I developed in 2004 to address a personal
challenge I faced in choosing a suitable academic specialization during high school. The scale aims to identify and
understand individualsâ€™ psychological and cognitive inclinations through symbolic three-letter codes. Each code
represents a unique combination of leadership style, emotional and social intelligence, core strengths, and
recommended hobbies. These are then translated into algorithmic models capable of predicting relative productivity
potential in academic and professional fields.

<h4>Definition of the Scale<h4>
BEGINING is a symbolic analytical tool designed to explore the foundations of intellectual, behavioral, and societal
excellence. It classifies individuals into 120 unique three-letter codes, each representing a specific combination of
traits, capabilities, and inclinations. The model provides a framework for constructing relative cognitive awareness
and can be used to model how individuals process and develop their internal potential.

<h4>Objectives<h4>
To analyze personality traits in a concise yet in-depth manner, with a focus on cognitive abilities.
To guide individuals toward appropriate academic, professional, or hobby-related choices.
To understand dynamics of leadership and social interaction.
To convert the analytical structure into algorithmic models that simulate artificial human-like consciousness.

I am Ibrahim Mohamed Ahmed Hussain, affirm that I am the sole creator of the BEGINING Scale. It was established
based on research and experimentation over 15 years, beginning in 2004 with the first development phase and the
formulation of the original BEGINING model. The second phase involved testing and refining the scale with over
6,000 individuals over a ten-year period, culminating in the creation of 120 algorithmic codes designed to simulate
and structure artificial awareness.
